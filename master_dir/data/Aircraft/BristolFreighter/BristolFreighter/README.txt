Handling Info
=============

This FG model stalls a bit fast, around 90-100kts depending on flap setting, but drops one wing
in the stall just like the real one.  It floats quite a bit on aproach and landing, just as the 
real on does so slow down early in the approach.  It also loses much of the aileron authority
at low speeds just as the real one was reported to do, so plan ahead!


Useful Keys
===========

d - opens/closes nose doors
l - toggles tail wheel lock
