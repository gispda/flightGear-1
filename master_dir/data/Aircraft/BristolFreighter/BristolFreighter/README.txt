HANDLING INFO
=============

The FDM is only my initial configuration.  While it still needs more work, basic handling is
as expected for the Freighter.  The main issue is that it stalls a bit fast, around 90-100kts 
depending on flap setting (compared to 55-71 on the real one), but drops one wing in the stall 
just like the real one.  It floats quite a bit on aproach and landing, just as the real on does 
so slow down early in the approach.  It also loses much of the aileron authority at low speeds 
just as the real one was reported to do, so plan ahead!


USEFUL KEYS
===========

d - opens/closes nose doors
l - toggles tail wheel lock


*** LIVERIES ***
================

I have released this model with a temporary texture map and livery for Trans-Provincial Airlines.
This texture map *WILL* change as I refine the model.  *Please* do not upload liveries to the main liveries
page until I refine the model and re-work the texture map.  If you create liveries  using this map, 
please share them!  Either post them to the forum in my Bristol Freighter thread:

	https://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=30976

or email them to me:

	owenpsmith@shaw.ca

and I will include them in the next release.
